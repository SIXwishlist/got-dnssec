About
=========================================================================
A website designed to allow web apps to figure out if a person as IPv6
connectivity, and that their IP address is.

The original site can be found at http://ipv6only.me/

Set Up
=========================================================================
Setting up your own copy of ipv6only.me is relatively simple.

Step 1 - Create an IPv6 only DNS name. It should *only* have AAAA
         records.

The ipv6only.me domain is complete IPv6 only, it doesn't even use IPv4 for
DNS resolution (see the include example.hosts file). This makes sure that
every part in the user's pipeline is correctly IPv6 enabled. I highly
recommend this is you want to be absolutely certain their IPv6 setup
is complete.

Step 2 - Deploy the application to Apache (with PHP installed) at the
         root directory of your new IPv6 website.

Step 3 - (Optional) If you want to see who ends up at your website
	 enable Google Analytics by creating a PHP file with the
         following contents;

```php
<?php
$analytics = 'YOUR UA ID GOES HERE';
```

Step 4 - Test it all works!
